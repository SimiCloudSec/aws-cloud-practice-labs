# Deliverable 002 – AWS CloudTrail Logging & SOC Event Analysis


**Date Completed:** June 15, 2025  
**Environment:** AWS Practice Account, Kali Linux VM  
**AWS Services Used:** CloudTrail, S3, IAM  
**Logging Target:** S3 Bucket `cloudtrail-logs-simi-001`


---


## 🎯 Objective


To enable CloudTrail in a multi-region setup and log all account activity into a dedicated S3 bucket. This includes capturing CLI/API calls, console actions, and IAM changes for review and incident detection, like a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst would.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed


1. **Created a new CloudTrail trail**
   - Name: `practice-cloudtrail-001`
   - Applied to all regions
   - Logs stored in: `cloudtrail-logs-simi-001`


2. **Generated cloud activity:**
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls --profile practice
   aws s3 cp test.txt s3://s3-practice-simi-001 --profile practice
   aws ec2 describe-regions --profile practice


## 🔍 Sample Events Observed


While reviewing the **Event History** in AWS CloudTrail, I confirmed that the following key activities were captured and logged successfully:


| Event Name         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CreateTrail        | Enabled logging for all regions in the account                              |
| PutBucketPolicy    | Applied permissions to allow CloudTrail to write to the log S3 bucket       |
| CreateBucket       | Created the destination S3 bucket to hold logs                              |
| CreateAccessKey    | Created access keys for CLI use (part of IAM test)                          |
| EnableMFADevice    | Enabled MFA for the IAM user (security hardening)                           |


### ✅ Log Visibility Confirmed:
All of these events were logged under the `root` user in my practice account — showing that CloudTrail captured management-level actions. In a real SOC environment, root usage is avoided, but this lab used it for full visibility while learning.
